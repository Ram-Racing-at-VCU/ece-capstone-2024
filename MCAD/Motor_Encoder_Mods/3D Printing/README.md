You're gonna need three M2 hex nuts in order to make the enclosure part. If you want to use the provided G-code (used for a PRUSA MK3S+), it will pause the print at a specific layer height and that is when you can insert the hex nuts. Feel free to slice the .stl file and do it yourself with your specific printer.
